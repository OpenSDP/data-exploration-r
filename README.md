## OpenSDP Data Janitor Tutorial (R)
## Data Exploration

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide an R introduction for education data analysts, and to demonstrate useful data exploration commands. You don't need to know any R to do this tutorial. In Part 1, you will see how to use data exploration commands to inspect a student-level dataset. In Part 2, you'll get practice using data exploration commands to answer simple research questions.

To run this tutorial you will need R Studio version 1.0 or higher.
Download the R .zip file and unzip the contents into a folder on your Desktop.
Double-click to open the data_exploration_tutorial.Rmd file in the folder
using R Studio. In the file viewer pane, you'll see a set of commands with
a grey background. Click on the small green triangle on the right margin of
line 13 to run the commands. Then, scroll down to read through the content
in the file viewer pane (this is the tutorial). As you see each grey
section of code, click on the green arrow to run the commands. You will
see the results in the window below. Use the results to answer the
questions in the tutorial. For Part 1 you can check your answers by
double-clicking on the part_one_key.html file to open the answer key
in your browser.
